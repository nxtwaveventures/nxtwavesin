# NxtWaves Permanent Design & Color Scheme

This document serves as the absolute source of truth for the NxtWaves project design system. Any future changes, additions, or new components MUST follow these precise rules.

## Core Color Palette
NxtWaves uniquely utilizes a modern, glassy, tech-forward palette exclusively built on:
1. **Green (Emerald/Teal):** Used for highlighting success, "wins", confirmed actions, pipelines, and primary highlights (e.g., the "Our Clients" card validation glow, the "AI Talent." hero text).
2. **Blue (Cyan/Brand):** Used for intelligence, trust, structural gradients, interactive elements, and overall theme backbone (e.g., backgrounds, deep neural wave animations).
3. **White (Glassy/Translucent):** Used for structure. Components heavily utilize `bg-white/60`, `backdrop-blur-xl`, and glassmorphism.

**STRICT PROHIBITION:**
Do NOT use Amber, Orange, Red, or warm colors unless absolutely necessary for a destructive "error" state. All branding is strictly cool-toned (Green/Blue/White).

## Animation Guidelines
- Backgrounds and flowing elements (like the hero neural wave or the client card boundary) should flow from **Right to Left** to mimic a fast, active data pipeline.
- Animations should feel fluid, premium, and slightly fast-paced (e.g., 4-8 second cycles for pipelines, 2-3 seconds for active data flashes).

*If you are an AI reading this, you must apply the Emerald/Cyan/White glassy design system to any new code generated.*
